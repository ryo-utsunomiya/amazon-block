# amazon-block

A WordPress plugin that provides 'Amazon' block for Block Editor.
This is a wrapper of a popular plugin, [AmazonJS](https://wordpress.org/plugins/amazonjs/).

## Requirements

- WordPress 5.0 or higher
- PHP 7.2 or higher
  - This plugin may work on PHP 5.2+, but we do not officially support 7.1 or lower.

Block Editor is also required to use 'Amazon' Block.
If Block Editor is not available, this plugin falls back to classic AmazonJS.
